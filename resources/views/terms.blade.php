                    <p><strong>1.2</strong> The Withdraw Service is offered by Kaskazi Solutions Limited’s platform (“Pitisha” or “we”).</p>

                        Service. Upon accessing the Withdraw Service, the User hereby acknowledges and accepts these terms.</p>

                    <p><strong>2.1.3</strong> The Withdraw Service is not a common carrier or public utility.</p>

                        debit or credit card can be used, excluding PIN based debit cards. Business credit cards must be open to transact

                    <p><strong>2.2.2.2</strong> The PayPal verification process is a PayPal process and Pitisha cannot intervene in this
                        process;</p>

                    <p><strong>2.2.3.1</strong> We may suspend your use of the Withdraw Service if you are unable to

                    <h5 class="info-title">3. Your contact information.</h5>
                    <p><strong>3.1</strong> It is your responsibility to keep your primary email address and phone number up to date so
                        that Pitisha can communicate with you electronically. You understand and agree that if Pitisha sends you an electronic
                        communication (email or SMS) but you do not receive it because your primary email address or mobile phone number on
                        file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic
                        communications, Pitisha will be deemed to have provided the communication to you effectively. Please note that if
                        you use a spam filter that blocks or re- routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must
                        add Pitisha to your email address book so that you will be able to view the communications we send to you.</p>
                    <p><strong>3.2</strong> You can update your primary email address or mobile phone number details at any time by logging
                        into the Pitisha website on www.pitisha.com. If your email address becomes invalid such that electronic communications
                        sent to you by Pitisha are returned, Pitisha may deem your Account to be inactive, and you will not be able to
                        transact any activity using your Pitisha e-wallet account until we receive a valid, working primary email address
                        from you.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h5 class="info-title">4. Identity Verification.</h5>
                    <p><strong>4.1</strong> You authorize Pitisha, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider
                        necessary to validate your identity. This may include asking you for further information or documentation, requiring
                        you to provide a taxpayer or national identification number, requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your
                        email address or financial instruments, ordering a credit report or verifying your Information against third party
                        databases or through other sources.</p>
